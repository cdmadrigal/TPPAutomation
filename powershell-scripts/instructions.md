# Powershell scripts for AD setup.

## In this folder...
Powershell scripts that are needed to get Microsoft AD setup within the TPP instance. These scripts will only be used if you elect to support & install Microsoft AD within TPP. 

## Suggested usage:
For quick and dirty deployments feel free to use the scripts as is. Best practices suggest you fork this repository to your GitHub account and use that as your working repository. That will give you control of the scripts and any changes made to them. If you choose to work from a forked version of the main repository, please keep the folder structure the same. The 'tpp-ec2-install' template relies on these files being in the proper folder structure to work correctly. You will also need to change the 'GitHubRepository' parameter from the default version <cdmadrigal> to the name of the GitHub account youre using, example: <venafi>.
